In the newly opened tab, choose Functional -> Automate runs via CLI. In the tab beneath that pops up (Run on Postman CLI), there are 2 Postman CLI commands that will be necessary to run on the second terminal.

Therefore, it is necessary to generate a API Key by pressing the corresponding button. Afterwards, the commands should be in this format:
>postman login --with-api-key <API_KEY_GENERATED>
>postman collection run <COLLECTION_ID>

These commands should then be copy and pasted on the new terminal window, as such:

#### Result
A folder named ZipDocsExtracted.zip will appear after the end of the scripts runs, containing all the files extracted.
